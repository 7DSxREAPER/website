This site is designed to supersede the old setup of individual sites for each group.  The groups all share 1 page with anchors to the appropriate section.

# Adding dates do the calendar:

To add/adjust/remove dates on the calendar, you will need to modify the `js/calendar-dates.js` file and make the appropriate adjustments.  This JS file is simply just a dictionary of the dates currently set and does not contain any actual code.  There is documentation in the JS file itself as well as some examples for things like the racing or gaming events.
